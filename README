This program is set up for the following assignment:


For these exercises we will use Selenium to test the GUI of a web-application. Selenium is a powerful open-source
framework for automated web testing. It has two different versions, 1) the WebDriver, and 2) the IDE.
1. Selenium IDE
Using the Selenium IDE we can easily record and playback scripts. However, we cannot (yet) export them.
We will thus use a different tool called Katalon. You can install this tool by searching the Add-on’s in Firefox.

These exercises will be verified using Ubuntu and Firefox. Feel free to use your favourite browser,
but make sure that your scripts work with Firefox on Ubuntu.

Keep in mind that the goal of these exercises is to test the interface, not the implementation.

For this particular exercise, u need to use a framework for Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) and
a scripting language, e.g. JBehave and Groovy together with JUnit Stories (or Gherkin, ....).
you can use the Selenium IDE to export code, but these scripts should be runnable java programs (use maven).
U can also use the Selenium webdriver if u want to.
Use a recent version of firefox and Selenium that are compatible with each other.

Create the following script and export its code. You need to make sure that the script can run using javac.
The script is the following:
Create a test script that navigates to all the different courses from the menu (the menu is left on the
homepage of the site http://ansymore.uantwerpen.be/, then u click on courses in the menu,
u come on a site where there is a link to all different courses with the professor(s) underneath it,
when u click on each course there opens a page with more information eg about the professor name(s)).
The script should loop over the different menu items and verify that each page is loaded.
Verify that each course has a professor (field not empty).
The script should only fail when a page cannot be loaded or when the course does not have a professor.”
